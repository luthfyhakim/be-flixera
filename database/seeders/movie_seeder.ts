The story centers on a documentary crew investigating a shaman named Nim in a rural village in Thailand. Nim claims to be possessed by a benevolent spirit, but when her niece, Mink, begins showing signs of strange behavior, it becomes apparent that something far more malevolent may be at work. The crew documents Nim’s attempts to help Mink, uncovering disturbing events that blur the line between spiritual possession and mental illness.Praised for its unsettling atmosphere and documentary-style filmmaking, The Medium explores themes of faith, family, and cultural beliefs in supernatural forces. The film’s realistic portrayal of rituals and its gradual descent into horror received critical acclaim, though its intense and graphic scenes make it a challenging watch. The film went on to become a significant success in Asia and was lauded for its chilling narrative and performances.",

What initially seems like an idyllic, peaceful retreat soon turns sinister as the villagers reveal their unsettling customs and rituals, leading to a nightmarish journey of psychological horror. The film explores themes of grief, trauma, and isolation, set against the backdrop of a pagan cult's traditions. Its slow-burning tension is punctuated by surreal and disturbing imagery, making it a unique entry in the folk horror subgenre. Pugh's performance was widely praised, solidifying her as one of the standout actresses of her generation.",
